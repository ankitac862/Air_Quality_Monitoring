# Air_Quality_Monitoring

The app shows the air quality index along with the specialised UI.

###### Logic

It uses the socket connection for the data of different cities with their AQI.
The app uses the data binding for the UI componants.
It first uses the hashmap so as to identify the unique data which is then converted with list to display on the screen for user.
On clicking particular city it displays its AQI on chart which refreshes every 30 seconds
